## Typographical and grammatical errors

If you spot a typo, spelling mistake, poor grammar (no matter how minor), or just feel a sentence/paragraph could be rewritten to improve clarity, I would greatly appreciate you reporting it.  You can do that by raising a Github issue via the repository.  The url is [https://github.com/health-data-science-OR/coding-for-ml/issues](https://github.com/health-data-science-OR/coding-for-ml/issues)

When you submit an issue please provide:

* link to page of book with the error
* Original sentence(s) that contain the error.
* Suggested fix
* Label the problem as `documentation`.

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in any of the code examples including solutions to exercises please report via [Github issues](https://github.com/health-data-science-OR/coding-for-ml/issues).  Please provide the following:

* The operating system and version you are using.
* Details of your python dependencies or virtual environment if you are using one. (if using conda please provide a environment.yml file - see the conda exercises for help )
