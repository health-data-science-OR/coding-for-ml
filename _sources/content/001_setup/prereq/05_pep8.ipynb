    "# Coding Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning to code is hard.  Learning to code to a level suitable for industry, research, and publication is harder.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work in a health data science job you will quickly find that sloppy, inconsistent or confused code isnâ€™t acceptable to your fellow data scientists.  Unclean code that does not follow a common style leads to (more) mistakes, difficulties in others understanding your aim(s), and hampers the ability for others (and yourself) to maintain the code base longer term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is no exception.  I encourage you to look at and use Python's [PEP8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) coding standards.  Where I can I try to follow PEP8 standards with my own code.  I'm not always successful.  If you see any code in this book that you think falls short of a good standard then do let me know and I will revise it!\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you on your clean code journal I'll summarise a few of the quick wins here.  If you follow these I guarantee it will help clean up your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Wins for coding standards\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted I strongly recommend checking out PEP8 in detail.  However, here are a few quick wins to get you started:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable naming\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to be able to store data and results of calculations in ways we can re-use. For this we define variables names. In python variables names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. \n",
    "\n",
    "In python we tend to prefer using variables names that are all lower case with under scores.Here is a simple pythonic versus non-pythonic style example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# preferred style\n",
    "hospital_id = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# not pythonic\n",
    "hospitalID = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# another non-pythonic style\n",
    "Hospital_id = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes python modules and packages will contain module level scope variables that you wish to treat as **constants** (as python is dynamically typed there is no real constant primitive).  In these cases it is usual to use uppercase with underscores.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "DEFAULT_N_PATIENTS = 172\n",
    "DEFAULT_N_WARDS = 13\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Give variables meaningful names\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names should be descriptive, without being too long. For example `mc_wheels` is better than just `wheels`, and `number_of_wheels_on_a_motorycle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's a bit abstract.  Let's take a look at a more practical example below. Scan over the code listing quickly. What is its purpose?"

    "\n",
    "In python we usually keep line length to 79 or 80 characters.  That is a line that exceeds this length breaks PEP8 coding standards.  More concretely - it becomes harder to read the code!  This is partly due to (old) monitor size, but also coders usually have more than one window open at a time.  Long unbroken lines of code can be hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no real excuse for having extremely long lines of code.  Python syntax and all major IDEs makes it easy to split lines.  In Jupyter, for example, make sure to head over to advanced settings and add in a ruler for code cells at either 79 or 80 characters. Here is a simple example where the backslash character is used to break up a string over multiple lines."
