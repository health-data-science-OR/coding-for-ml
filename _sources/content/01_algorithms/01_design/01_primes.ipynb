As we work out which numbers are not primes we will cross (sieve) them out. For simplicity of illustration we will store those in a list called `crossed_out` \n",

We'll need some test data first.  The dict `n_primes` holds the number of primes up to a value of n increasing by a factor of 10 each time.  For example, there are 25 primes numbers in the first 100 natural numbers."
