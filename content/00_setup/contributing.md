# Contributing

I welcome contributions to the book.  In each case credit will be given.  Please do not feel you need to be an expert to contribute all views and feedback are greatly appreciated.  You can contribute in the following ways:

## Typographical and grammatical errors

If you spot a typo, spelling mistake, poor grammar (no matter how minor), or just feel a sentence/paragraph could be rewritten to improve clarity, I would greatly appreciate you reporting it.  You can do that by raising a Github issue via the repository.  The url is [https://github.com/health-data-science-OR/coding-for-ml/issues](https://github.com/health-data-science-OR/coding-for-ml/issues)

When you submit an issue please provide:

* link to page of book with the error
* Original sentence(s) that contain the error.
* Suggested fix
* Label the problem as `documentation`.

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in any of the code examples including solutions to exercises please report via [Github issues](https://github.com/health-data-science-OR/coding-for-ml/issues).  Please provide the following:

* The operating system and version you are using.
* Details of your python dependencies or virtual environment if you are using one. (if using conda please provide a environment.yml file - see the conda exercises for help )
* Steps to reproduce the problem including the url.
* Please label the problem as `bug`
* **Optional**: recommended fix.

> Note: Before reporting a bug please check that the Jupyter notebook cells have been been run in **order**.  I recommend selecting 'Reset Kernel and Clear All Outputs' from the Kernel menu and rerunning the notebook to confirm.
