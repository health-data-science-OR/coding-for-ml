For example, if you create a python module that includes variable that you are going to effectively treat as constants then any function or class within the module can use them directly.  A similar pattern can be applied within a Jupyter notebook.  In fact, because notebooks usually contain lots of scripting you usually have a lot of variables with notebook level scope (this can occationally lead to mistakes and bugs - be careful!)."
