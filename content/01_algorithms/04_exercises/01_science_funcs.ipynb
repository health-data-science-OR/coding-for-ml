    "These exercises are designed to refresh and in some cases challenge your python knowlege and problem solving skills.  They are a mix of classic scientific coding problems and coding interview type questions found on sites such as [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note** that the solutions to these exercises are in **standard** Python.  If you have knowledge of scientific python libraries such as `numpy` or `scipy` and are **confident** in using them to complete the exercises then that is fine.  However, don't feel you need to overcomplicate your code.  There are seperate exercises for `numpy`.\n",

    "* Time your solutions to identify if you have improved run time. \n",
    "* Keep your solutions readable.  Write good quality human readable code and give your functions PEP8 docstrings.\n",
